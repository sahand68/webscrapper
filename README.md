# SEO Optimization Tool


 ## Documentation

    ### Overview

    This script is designed to be a simple and flexible tool for scraping blog data from websites. It features a user interface built with Streamlit, enhancing user interaction and accessibility. The script uses the requests library to handle HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. Additionally, it leverages langchain and claude-sonnet-3.5 to analyze pages for keywords, providing deeper insights into the scraped data.

    ### Modules and Functions

    - **Modules Used:**
      - requests: For making HTTP requests.
      - beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
      - pandas: For handling data and exporting to Excel.
      - urllib.parse: For constructing absolute URLs.
      - streamlit: For building the user interface.
      - langchain: For processing and analyzing text.
      - crewai: For using anthropic models.  ( analysing blog content)
      - claude-sonnet-3.5: For advanced keyword analysis.

    ### How It Works

    1. **Fetch the Main Page:**
    
       - The script sends a GET request to the base URL.
       - Parses the HTML content to find all blog links.
    
    2. **Extract Blog Links:**
    
       - Searches for <a> tags with href attributes containing /blog/.
       - Constructs absolute URLs and adds them to a list.
    
    3. **Process Each Blog Page:**
    
       - Sends a GET request to each blog URL.
       - Parses the page to extract the blog name and SEO keywords using langchain and claude-sonnet-3.5.
    
    4. **Save Data to Excel:**
    
       - Creates a pandas DataFrame from the collected data.
       - Exports the DataFrame to an Excel file using to_excel().
    
    ### Error Handling
    
    - **Network Errors:**
    
      - You can add try-except blocks around HTTP requests to handle exceptions like timeouts or connection errors.
    
    - **Missing Data:**
    
      - The script checks if certain tags exist before attempting to extract text to avoid AttributeError.
    
    ### Potential Enhancements
    
    - **Multithreading or Asynchronous Requests:**
    
      - For large numbers of blog posts, consider using concurrent.futures or asyncio to speed up the scraping process.
    
    - **Command-Line Arguments:**
    
      - Use the argparse module to accept command-line arguments for the base URL and output file name.
    
    - **Logging:**
    
      - Implement logging to keep track of the script's progress and errors.
